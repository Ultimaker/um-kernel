"""Refuse commits on branches this repository actually protects.

The protected list is NOT `["main", "master", "staging"]`. That guess was
simultaneously too wide (forbidding `master` in a repository that has none) and
too narrow (waving through a direct commit to the release branch this project
actually protects). The bootstrap asks GitHub for the real answer via
`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches` and renders it below.
