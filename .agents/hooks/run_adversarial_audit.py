run_adversarial_audit.py
Automated Adversarial Security, Quality Gate & Intent Scope Audit Script.

Scans git diff and commit history for:
1. Hardcoded absolute paths (e.g. user home directories)
2. Private keys, API tokens, credentials
3. Python error swallowing
4. Raw hex colour literals in themeable sources — NOT just QML: React, Python
   UIs and stylesheets hardcode `#RRGGBB` just as readily
5. Interface changes that leave the API documentation behind
6. Edits to trees this repository vendors but does not own

Every folder list this script uses is discovered at bootstrap and rendered in
from ONE source (`hooks/partials/_repo_layout.py.j2`). Earlier revisions carried
private hardcoded copies of an interface directory, a vendor directory and a
default-branch list — literals lifted from one firmware repository, meaningless
in every other repository the bootstrap touched.

# ONE source for the folder lists. Several hooks used to carry their own
# hardcoded copies of a vendor-directory list and of a default-branch list,
# which was both duplication and wrong: a firmware repository vendors into its
# own SDK directory and protects a release branch under a project-specific
# name, and no hardcoded copy could know either.

# Every value below comes from the investigation the bootstrap ran against THIS
# repository — not from a default list. Re-run the bootstrap with `--update`
