check_atomic_bisect_history.py

`git bisect` is only useful if every commit on the branch BUILDS. A tidy commit
title does not give you that; a build does. So this hook checks both:

  1. History hygiene — no `fixup!`/`squash!`/WIP titles left before a push.
  2. Buildability — the repository's OWN build (and, if quick, test) command is
     run against the committed tree, so a branch that cannot compile is caught
     here rather than in the middle of a bisect three months from now.

The build commands below were detected from this repository at bootstrap time.
Set `SKIP_BISECT_BUILD=1` to skip step 2 when you know the build is expensive.
