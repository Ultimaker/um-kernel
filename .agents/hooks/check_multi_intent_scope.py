check_multi_intent_scope.py — the repository's single scope gate.

This absorbs the old `check-relevant-scope.py`. The two hooks asked the same
question ("is this change one thing?") and answered it twice: one counted files
against an arbitrary threshold, the other clustered directories. A count is not
evidence of scope creep — a rename touches sixty files with one intent, and two
files in unrelated subsystems are two intents. So this hook does exactly two
things:

  * BLOCKS the one objective violation — staged edits to trees this repository
    vendors but does not own.
  * REPORTS the changed-file list, grouped by where those files live, and hands
    the judgement to the agent. No threshold, no guessing.
